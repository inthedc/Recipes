Italian Red Sauce (Gravy)
===================

This recipe is my own invention based on having eaten far too much Italian sauce and then experimenting in the @intheDC test kitchen until I was satisfied.  This isn't as authentic as going from raw ingredients, but given that it includes fresh ingredients and fresh-canned individual ingredients, I'm going to call it fresh.  And, given that the criteria for a patent is generally a few existing items put together in a novel way, I'm calling it mine as well.  Debate away, but really, you should just shut it and cook.

The recipe below makes enough to serve with 12+ meatballs, and then some.  Approx 5 quarts.

----------

Ingredients
-------------

> **Red Sauce Components:**

> - (2) 29oz. Crushed Tomatoes
> - (1) 29oz. Tomato Puree
> - (1) 29oz. Petite Diced Tomatoes
> - (1) 6oz. Tomato Paste
> - (5) Garlic Cloves
> - (2) Tbsp. Kosher Salt
> - (1) Tbsp. Ground Pepper (Fresh is best)
> - 1/2 Sweet Yellow or White Onion
> - 1/3 - 1/4 Bottle of [5th Season Italian Seasoning][1] (or similar)

----------

Cooking Tools
-------------

> - (1) 7 Quart Crock Pot like this one from [Amazon][2]

> **Note:** I much prefer the crock pot / slow cooker because of the ease of use and the cleanup (you'll see a trend here).  This model in particular, is so awesome that I have 3 of them!  Also, getting one with digital settings, fancy whatever, and even going upscale to an All-Clad doesn't pay off.  It's my nature to buy the cadillac of products, and for crock pots, **THIS ONE IS IT**.

----------

Cooking Process
-------------------

> - Turn the Crock Pot on High.
> - Empty the contents of all of the cans into the pot and stir - let them warm up while you:
> - Dice the onion - if you don't know what size a dice is, look [here][3] 
> - Thinly slice the garlic - I used to do it by hand, it gets sticky, now I use one of [these][4]
> - Combine Onions, Garlic Slices, Italian Seasoning, Salt, and Pepper.
> - Stir the entire mixture until fully combined and simmer with the lid on for 2 hours, stirring occasionally.
> - If adding [meatballs], do so after about 1.5 - 2 hours, simmer on high for another hour.
> - Reduce to low after 3-4 hours and simmer for another 2-4 hours, stirring occasionally.
> - At the end of 6-8 hours, it is ready to serve.  Onions will be translucent, and garlic will be soft or even disintegrated.
> - Serve over traditional Spaghetti noodles. and garnish with fresh grated parmesean.
> - Don't be afraid to add the entire onion, additional garlic, or even red pepper flake (sparingly) depending on your taste!
