Meatballs (fried)
===================

This recipe is my combination of a few different meatball recipes I've seen over the years.  I'm a big fan of meatballs - and it's critical to define exactly what a meatball is.  They **MUST** be at least golfball-sized to at least be considered a meatball.  They ***should*** have at least two types of meat in them as well.  After that, the customizations are endless... adding in things like bread, seasonings, eggs / other binders, preparation methods, and of course the classic "healthy" option.  

The recipe below makes about 12-13 tennis ball sized meatballs.

----------

Ingredients
-------------

> **Meatball Components:**

> - (2) lb. 80/20 Ground Beef (sometimes known as ground chuck)
> - (2) lb Ground Pork (this will be very fatty)
> - 1 Tbsp. (ish) Salt
> - 1 Tbsp. (ish) Pepper

> **Fying Components:**

> - (2) Qt. Vegetable oil

----------

Cooking Tools
-------------

> **For Making the Meatballs:**

> - (1) Large Mixing / Serving Bowl like this 14" one from [Ikea][1]

> **For Frying The Meatballs:**

> - (1) Stainless Steel Skimmer like this one from [Amazon][2]
> - (1) Enameled Cast Iron Dutch Oven like this one from [Amazon][3]

> **Note:** I much prefer an enameled cast iron for frying because of the ease of cleanup and the capacity.  Certainly a deep fryer would also work, or any other method you're used to frying other food items with as well.

----------

Cooking Process
-------------------

> - Let both the pork and the ground beef acclimate to almost room temperature.
> - Heat the oil to 350 degrees.
> - ** In a pot or high-walled frying pan use enough oil to cover the meatballs by 50% once in the oil.
> - ** Consider the impact of over-filling a shallow pan and spilling the oil onto the heating element, please.  Remember the turkey fryer incidents!
> - ** If you are using a deep fryer, simply fill to the standard fill line and proceed with caution.
> - In the mixing bowl combine 2lbs. of ground beef and 2lbs of ground pork.
> - While mixing thoroughly (without over-mixing the meat and destroying the texture) sprinkle with the salt and pepper.
> - After the meat is combined, form into balls by rolling between your hands.  the balls should be approximately 1/3 lb. each and be about tennis-ball sized.
> - Add the meatballs to the oil using the stainless steel skimmer (or fryer basket), as to not splatter oil yourself.  Do not over-crowd.
> - Cook meatballs until browned like a normal hamburger patty.
> -- if they are fully submerged, continually roll/stir them to help with heat distribution
> -- if they are not fully submerged, cook one side until almost fully done, then rotate halfway to finish the second side.
> - After they are fully cooked, best practice is to combine them with a Red Sauce and simmer for 4+ hours, to impart the flavor of the meatball into the sauce, and vice versa.
